p1u	1		Triggered by the user pressing a button that says something like "Discuss the information with the app" while the user is looking at p1's data	Which time period would you like to look at?	Week 1 to week 8;101|Week 9 to week 10;102|Week 11 to week 12;103|Week 7 to week 10;104			
p1u	101			Ok, let's look at week 1 to week 8 then. 				
p1u	9101		Case1: User selects any period across the first 8 weeks, where there has been a steady increase in temperature difference.	We can see that the temperature difference between your healthy foot and your foot ulcer increased. This means it's likely that your foot ulcer has been getting worse. Would you like us to look together at the data more closely and see if we can understand why your foot ulcer has been getting worse?	Yes;201|No;601			
p1u	201		If Yes, then	Let's look at the data that shows how often you wear your boot when you are at home, when you are at work and when you are out. 			HighlightData	
p1u	301			We can see that during this time period you often didn’t wear your boot while you were at home.			HighlightData	
p1u	9301			We can see that you take around {{p1u1stepsHome}} steps a week while you are at home. Because you weren't wearing your boot much at home, this means that you weren't wearing your boot for many of the steps you took.				
p1u	401			In total you only wore your boot for {{p1u1stepsPercTotal}}% of the steps you took. It's likely that your foot ulcer has got worse because you haven't been wearing your boot as much as you should.			HighlightData	
p1u	501			For the best chance of a good recovery, you should wear your boot all the time you are active. This means you need to wear it when you are at home as well as when you go out.				
p1u	9501			Thanks for talking with me. I hope this has been helpful. Bye!	END;0

p1u	801	2	If Because I don't understand what you mean, then	If we look at the information I’ve been collecting about your foot then we can see whether there’s anything you have been doing that could be stopping your ulcer from healing. Would you like us to do this now?	Yes;901|No;1301			
p1u	901	3	If Yes, then	Let's look at the data that shows how often you wear your boot when you are at home, when you are at work and when you are out. 			HighlightData	
p1u	9901			We can see that you often didn’t wear your boot while you were at home.

p1u	102		Case2: User selects any period across weeks 9 and 10, where there has been a modest decrease in temperature difference.	Ok, let's look at week 9 to week 10 then. 				
p1u	9102			We can see that the temperature difference between your healthy foot and your foot ulcer decreased a bit. This means it's likely that your foot ulcer has been getting better. Would you like us to look together at the data more closely and see if we can understand why your foot ulcer has been getting better? 	Yes;202|No;502			
p1u	202		If Yes, then	Let's look at the data that shows how often you wear your boot when you are at home, when you are at work and when you are out. 			HighlightData

p1u	702	2	If Because it’s boring, then	It will only take a minute or two and it might help you understand more about how foot ulcers heal. Are you sure we can’t spend a few minutes looking at this together?	Ok;802|No, I don’t want to;1102

p1u	104		Case4: User selects any period that crosses the boundary of week 8 and 9, where the temperature difference switches from increasing to decreasing.	Ok, let's look at week 7 to week 10 then. 				
p1u	9104			We can see that in weeks 7 and 8, the temperature difference between your healthy foot and your foot ulcer increased. This means it's likely that your foot ulcer has been getting worse. But in weeks 9 and 10, the temperature difference between your healthy foot and your foot ulcer decreased. This means it's likely that your foot ulcer has been getting better.

p1sa	1		This dialogue assumes persona 1 at the end of week 12. Triggered by the researcher (to simulate the system being triggered by what it has seen in the data) the system will initiate the following dialogue.	Hi, you are doing really well with your boot at the moment! Have a look at the information for the last two weeks (so for weeks 11 and 12).  	I can’t talk now;20|OK;91			
p1sa	91			This week you have worn your boot for {{p1s1stepsPercTotal}}% of all the steps you took!	I think my boot has given me back ache. Is there anything I can do to make my back hurt less?;30|That's good, has my ulcer improved?;80			
p1sa	20		If I can’t talk now, then	Ok, you know where I am if you need me. Bye!	END;0			
p1sa	30		If I’ve been making myself wear my boot but it’s been giving me really bad back ache, is there anything I can do to make my back hurt less?, then	If you have another boot or shoe that’s a similar height to your boot then you could try wearing that on your healthy foot. This might reduce your back ache.				
p1sa	40			I’ve sent a message to your healthcare team to let them know that you might be suffering from back ache. They will be able to talk to you about different things you can try to make your pain better.				
p1sa	50			It’s really important that you keep wearing your boot. If you take a look at the temperature difference between your ulcer and your healthy foot then you can see that it's gone down by {{p1saTemp}} degrees over the past 2 weeks.			HighlightData	
p1sa	60			This is what we want to see, it suggests that your ulcer is improving. If you continue to wear your boot for most of your steps then we can expect your ulcer to keep getting better.
